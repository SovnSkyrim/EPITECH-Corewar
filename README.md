# Corewar: Back in the good old days...
My end of year project for my first year at EPITECH: the Corewar.

It is a compilator from pseudo ASM language to bytecode.

The goal is to understand bit operators and how the data is stored in C on a binary level, it is also to understand a complicated subject.

In the linked .pdf file, two parts were supposed to be made: the compilator and the virtual machine, but as I was alone (instead of 4) to make this project, I only did the compilator.

[Passed with C Grade and "Remarkable" comment.](http://prntscr.com/AktfBgZmeNzQ)

It is my favourite project of the year.
